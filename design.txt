thick at the base to just about 11 feet (3.3 m) in the upper parts.
 Over the bulwarks rise four turrets: three of them are square,
 however the one on the upper east is roundabout, to oblige a twisting flight of stairs.

The Tower has been the setting for probably the most groundbreaking occasions in European and British History.
 Its function as a phase whereupon history has been established is one of the key components 
which has contributed towards the Tower's status as a notable structure. Apparently,

 While from the start the plan is uniform, further assessment shows that the capitals are very shifted.
 Some are block-molded, some have volutes, and others are pad capitals.
